# Automated Unit Test Generation Research

## üéØ Objective

Develop a comprehensive process to automatically generate unit tests for existing codebases using AI assistance, with a focus on GitHub Copilot integration and systematic test coverage improvement.

## üîç Research Areas

### 1. Automated Test Generation Pipeline

#### Core Components
- **Code Analysis**: Scan existing codebase for testable functions and components
- **Test Framework Detection**: Identify existing testing setup and conventions
- **Gap Analysis**: Determine what tests are missing or inadequate
- **Test Generation**: Use AI to create comprehensive test suites
- **Validation**: Ensure generated tests are meaningful and pass

#### Implementation Strategy
```bash
# Proposed script structure
./scripts/generate-tests.sh [options]
  --scan-path <path>           # Directory to scan for code
  --test-path <path>           # Where to place generated tests
  --framework <jest|jasmine>   # Testing framework to use
  --coverage-threshold <num>   # Minimum coverage percentage
  --dry-run                    # Preview without creating files
  --interactive               # Ask for confirmation on each file
```

### 2. AI Integration Patterns

#### GitHub Copilot Optimization
- **Prompt Engineering**: Develop standardized prompts for different code patterns
- **Context Management**: Ensure relevant files are open for maximum AI context
- **Iterative Refinement**: Process for improving generated tests through AI feedback
- **Quality Validation**: Automated checks for test quality and completeness

#### Example Workflow
1. **Scan Phase**: Identify functions/methods without tests
2. **Context Phase**: Open related files (interfaces, types, existing tests)
3. **Generation Phase**: Use `/test` command with enhanced prompts
4. **Validation Phase**: Run tests and check coverage improvements
5. **Refinement Phase**: Enhance tests based on failures or gaps

### 3. Test Quality Metrics

#### Coverage Analysis
- **Line Coverage**: Percentage of code lines executed by tests
- **Branch Coverage**: Percentage of code branches tested
- **Function Coverage**: Percentage of functions with tests
- **Integration Coverage**: Cross-component interaction testing

#### Quality Indicators
- **Assertion Completeness**: Tests verify expected behavior thoroughly
- **Edge Case Coverage**: Tests handle boundary conditions and errors
- **Mock Quality**: Proper isolation of units under test
- **Test Maintainability**: Tests are readable and easy to update

## üõ†Ô∏è Proposed Implementation

### Phase 1: Code Discovery and Analysis

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Code discovery script

# Find all source files
find_source_files() {
    local scan_path="$1"
    find "$scan_path" -type f \( -name "*.js" -o -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.jsx" -o -name "*.tsx" \) \
        ! -path "*/node_modules/*" \
        ! -path "*/dist/*" \
        ! -path "*/*.test.*" \
        ! -path "*/*.spec.*"
}

# Analyze functions/methods in files
analyze_functions() {
    local file="$1"
    # Use AST parsing or regex to extract function signatures
    # Identify public methods, exported functions, React components
    # Generate metadata for test generation
}

# Check existing test coverage
check_coverage() {
    local file="$1"
    # Look for corresponding test files
    # Parse coverage reports if available
    # Identify untested functions
}
```

### Phase 2: AI-Powered Test Generation

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Test generation using GitHub Copilot

generate_tests_for_file() {
    local source_file="$1"
    local test_file="$2"
    
    # Open relevant context files in VS Code
    code "$source_file"
    code "${source_file%.*}.d.ts" 2>/dev/null  # Type definitions
    code "$(dirname "$source_file")/*.test.*" 2>/dev/null  # Existing tests
    
    # Generate comprehensive prompt
    local prompt="Generate comprehensive unit tests for $source_file including:
    - All public methods and functions
    - Edge cases and error conditions  
    - Mocking of external dependencies
    - Integration with existing test patterns
    - TypeScript type safety validation"
    
    # Use Copilot Chat API or interactive session
    echo "Prompt for Copilot: $prompt"
    
    # Create test file structure
    create_test_file_template "$test_file" "$source_file"
}

create_test_file_template() {
    local test_file="$1"
    local source_file="$2"
    
    cat > "$test_file" << EOF
import { describe, it, expect, jest } from '@jest/globals';
import { /* imports */ } from '$(basename "${source_file%.*}")';

describe('$(basename "${source_file%.*}")', () => {
  // Generated tests will be added here
  
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup
  });
  
  afterEach(() => {
    // Cleanup
  });
  
  // Test cases generated by AI
});
EOF
}
```

### Phase 3: Validation and Quality Assurance

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Test validation pipeline

validate_generated_tests() {
    local test_file="$1"
    
    echo "üîç Validating generated tests in $test_file"
    
    # Run tests to ensure they pass
    npm test "$test_file"
    local test_result=$?
    
    # Check coverage improvement
    npm run test:coverage
    
    # Validate test quality
    check_test_patterns "$test_file"
    check_assertion_quality "$test_file"
    check_mock_usage "$test_file"
    
    if [ $test_result -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "‚úÖ Tests pass and coverage improved"
        return 0
    else
        echo "‚ùå Generated tests have issues"
        return 1
    fi
}

check_test_patterns() {
    local test_file="$1"
    
    # Verify proper test structure
    grep -q "describe\|it\|test" "$test_file" || {
        echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Missing test structure patterns"
        return 1
    }
    
    # Check for proper assertions
    grep -q "expect\|assert" "$test_file" || {
        echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Missing assertions in tests"
        return 1
    }
    
    echo "‚úÖ Test patterns look good"
}
```
