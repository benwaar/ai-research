# AI Research & Development Experience


This repository contains research, documentation, and re-usabe processes for integrating AI-powered development tools into everyday workflows. My focus is on practical, actionable guidance that developers can immediately apply to improve their productivity.
I often use card games for experimenting with new technology as I like them :)

This project uses [Conventional Commits](docs/conventional-commits.md)

## üõ†Ô∏è Available Scripts

### Security Scripts
- **`scripts/setup-pii-check.sh`** - Install PII detection pre-commit hook in any repository
- **`scripts/pre-commit-pii-check.sh`** - Core PII detection script for git hooks

### Development Scripts
- **`scripts/setup-conventional-commits.sh`** - Configure conventional commits with optional tooling

### Usage Examples
```bash
# Setup PII check in current repository
./scripts/setup-pii-check.sh

# Setup conventional commits
./scripts/setup-conventional-commits.sh

# Interactive conventional commit
npm run commit

# Standard conventional commit  
git commit -m "feat(docs): add conventional commits guide"

# Test PII detection
echo "SSNC-internal" > test.txt
git add test.txt
git commit -m "test"  # Will be blocked by PII check
```
