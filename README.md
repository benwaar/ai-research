## üéì Plan of Study

A structured path for applying AI to real-world engineering workflows.

### **Phase 1 ‚Äì Practical AI for Developers**
- Master prompt design patterns for software tasks (structured, iterative, context-rich)
- Apply AI tools (Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.) for:
  - Test generation and debugging
  - Documentation and PR summaries
  - Process automation and code refactoring
- Build reusable **AI prompt templates** (‚ÄúAI macros‚Äù) for daily development tasks

### **Phase 2 ‚Äì Applied Engineering AI**
- Integrate AI into CI/CD and DevOps pipelines  
- Build **AI-assisted upgrade and migration tools** (e.g., Angular upgrade automation)  
- Research **AI-powered code review** and **dependency analysis**
- Develop AI-based quality and compliance checks

### **Phase 3 ‚Äì Agentic & Orchestrated Systems**
- Experiment with **agentic AI** for autonomous workflow coordination  
- Explore **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** and cross-tool AI integrations  
- Research AI-enhanced developer analytics and security governance  

### **Phase 4 ‚Äì Engineering Productivity & Security**
- Apply ML and analytics for delivery-time prediction and developer velocity  
- Strengthen software supply-chain security using automated PII detection and code scanning  
- Use AI insights to optimize development flow and reduce risk

# Add security pre-commit checks
./scripts/setup-pii-check.sh

# Setup Conventional Commits
./scripts/setup-conventional-commits.sh

# Test PII detection
echo "SSNC-internal" > test.txt
git add test.txt
git commit -m "test"   # ‚ùå blocked by hook
```

## Python Setup & Usage

To run Python examples:

1. Ensure your virtual environment is set up (Pyenv or .venv).
2. Use the provided script to activate and run:
    ```zsh
    ./run-python.sh
    ```
This will execute `src/agent.py` using your configured environment.
