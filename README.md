# AI Research & Development Experience

> Comprehensive guides and processes for leveraging AI tools to enhance developer productivity and streamline development workflows.

## üéØ Overview

This repository contains research, documentation, and proven processes for integrating AI-powered development tools into everyday workflows. My focus is on practical, actionable guidance that developers can immediately apply to improve their productivity.

## üìö Guides & Documentation

### Testing & Quality Assurance
- **[Using GitHub Copilot to write unit tests](github-copilot-unit-tests.md)**  
  *Comprehensive guide covering test generation, troubleshooting, and best practices for AI-assisted testing*

### Development Processes  
- **[Angular Library Upgrade Process](ANGULAR_UPGRADE_PROCESS.md)**  
  *Step-by-step automated process for upgrading Angular libraries with AI assistance*

## üöÄ AI-Powered Workflow Integration

### Getting Started with AI Processes

1. **Setup Your Environment**
   - Install GitHub Copilot in VS Code
   - Open your project workspace
   - Have the relevant process documentation accessible

2. **Execute AI-Guided Processes**
   - Open the process document in your workspace
   - Use Copilot Chat to guide you through each step
   - Leverage AI for troubleshooting and optimization

### Essential VS Code Shortcuts
- **Open Copilot Chat**: `Cmd + Shift + I` (macOS) / `Ctrl + Shift + I` (Windows/Linux)
- **Inline Copilot**: `Tab` to accept suggestions
- **Alternative Suggestions**: `Alt + ]` / `Alt + [`

## üõ†Ô∏è Best Practices

### Working with AI Processes
- **Context is Key**: Keep relevant files open in your workspace
- **Be Specific**: Provide clear, detailed prompts to get better results
- **Iterative Improvement**: Refine and enhance AI-generated content
- **Validate Results**: Always review and test AI-generated code

### Process Execution Tips
- Follow processes step-by-step rather than jumping ahead
- Use AI chat to ask questions when steps are unclear
- Document any improvements or issues encountered
- Share learnings with the team

## üéØ Future Research Areas

- [ ] **Automated Code Review Processes**: Using AI for PR reviews and feedback
- [ ] **Test Automation Scripts**: Developing scripts to automate unit test generation
- [ ] **Documentation Generation**: AI-assisted technical documentation creation
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: AI-guided code performance improvements
