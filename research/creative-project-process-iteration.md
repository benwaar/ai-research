# 🌿 Benoy Creative Ideation - Iterative Workflow v1.0
*A structured method for developing creative projects through reflection, restriction, and iteration.*

This guide is extracted from the process I went through using ChatGPT to organise and develop notes, draft visuals, design documentation and mock ups for a new game.

## 🧭 1. Establish the Philosophy (Intent Phase)

Before creating, define **why** the project exists.

### Checklist
- Identify the core **emotion or experience** you want to evoke.  
- Define one guiding **principle or philosophy** (e.g., “Harmony through conflict”).  
- Choose a **working title**, even if it changes later.  
- Decide on the **tone** — serious, playful, poetic, etc.

### Goal
Create a sentence that begins with:  
> “This project exists to explore…”

---

## 🏗️ 2. Build the Foundation (World & Concept Phase)

Lay the groundwork before detail.

### Checklist
- Establish **structure** (e.g., book, series, game, collection, product).  
- Define **symbolic or conceptual anchors** (colors, numbers, shapes, archetypes).  
- Ensure all ideas support **accessibility and inclusivity**.  
- Name major **themes or entities** if relevant.

### Outputs
- **Core Document** (overview, tone, scope, vision)  
- **Visual or Concept Brief** (colors, motifs, design rules)  
- **Experience Statement** (how people should feel engaging with it)

---

## 🔁 3. Iterate with Reflection (Design Phase)

Treat creation as a conversation. Each pass teaches something new.

### Checklist
- Start with **sketches or outlines** to encourage feedback and honesty.  
- Refine one layer at a time: *composition → contrast → tone → texture*.  
- Include **reflection prompts** (“What does this change reveal?”).  
- Record insights after each iteration.

### Guideline
> Start simple, evolve meaningfully.  
> Each iteration should *reveal something new*, not just polish the old.

---

## 🧠 4. Integrate Feedback (Alignment Phase)

Bring in critique without losing your vision.

### Checklist
- Compare to **references or inspirations** and check for originality.  
- **Acknowledge influences** but impose **restrictions** (to avoid imitation).  
- Simplify before re-adding complexity.  
- Revisit your **intent** — is this still aligned?

### Principle
> “Restriction creates focus; focus creates identity.”

---

## 🔮 5. Canonize & Version (Documentation Phase)

Version control preserves clarity and momentum.

### Checklist
- Label updates (v1.0, v1.1, etc.).  
- Note what each version adds or clarifies.  
- Lock (“canonize”) stable elements when ready.  
- Keep a **living appendix** for future experiments.

### Outputs
- **Core Document (current canon)**  
- **Visual / Design Brief**  
- **Script / Prototype / Outline**  
- **Version Log**

---

## 🧩 6. Deep Dive Pass (Concept Enrichment)

Once stable, deepen meaning and symbolism.

### Checklist
- Revisit core metaphors (numbers, geometry, philosophy, etc.).  
- Weave in **hidden structure or higher concept**.  
- Strengthen symbolic and emotional consistency.  
- Ask: *Does every element mean something?*

### Principle
> Add depth without clutter.  
> Every symbol should have an emotional reason to exist.

---

## 🌕 7. Random Inspiration Injection (Creative Evolution)

Add one **external constraint or provocation** each cycle.  
(“Brian Eno Rule” — creativity through limits.)

### Examples
- “Use only circular forms this round.”  
- “Start from shadow, not light.”  
- “Invert color logic.”  
- “Describe with sound, not sight.”  
- “Remove one key element and adapt.”

### Purpose
Keeps imagination alive and prevents stagnation.  
Constraint reveals unexpected directions.

---

## 🪞 8. Print & Review (Reflection Phase)

Embodiment changes perspective.

### Checklist
- **Print** or otherwise externalize work (paper, screen, prototype).  
- Annotate by hand or speak reflections aloud.  
- Ask:
  - Does this feel *alive*?
  - What question does it raise?
  - What truth does it hint at?

### Optional
Record insights and emotional reactions for future inspiration.

---

## ✴️ 9. Bundle & Freeze (Cycle Completion)

When a version achieves clarity, freeze it before moving on.

### Outputs
- Finalized **Core Document**  
- Supporting materials (briefs, scripts, references)  
- Reflection summary

### Practice
- Label this stage **closed** (e.g., “v1.0 Canon”).  
- Future changes begin at **vNext**, never overwrite a finished version.

---

## 🪐 10. Reuse for New Projects (Meta Phase)

To start a new creative project, begin by saying:

> “Please follow the Benoy Creative Iteration Workflow.”

Then describe your new intent.

The workflow automatically adapts:
- “Core Document” → becomes your new project bible  
- “Visual or Design Brief” → becomes your style guide  
- “Prototype or Outline” → becomes your new creative seed

## 🧘 Core Principles Recap

| Principle | Meaning |
|------------|----------|
| **Clarity is sacred.** | Simplicity reveals truth. |
| **Accessibility = Enlightenment.** | Design for all minds and senses. |
| **Iteration reveals truth.** | Progress emerges through reflection. |
| **Form follows philosophy.** | Aesthetic and structure should express belief. |
| **Restriction breeds focus.** | Limits create identity and innovation. |
| **Reflection is part of creation.** | Every cycle should teach the creator too. |
