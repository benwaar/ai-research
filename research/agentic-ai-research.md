# Agentic AI Research

> Understanding autonomous AI agents and their application in game environments

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

Agentic AI refers to autonomous systems that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals without constant human intervention. Unlike traditional AI that responds to prompts, agentic AI demonstrates agency - the ability to act independently and adapt to changing conditions.

## ðŸ§  Core Concepts

### What Makes AI "Agentic"?

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Autonomy**: Can operate independently without continuous human guidance
- **Goal-Oriented**: Works towards specific objectives or outcomes
- **Adaptive**: Adjusts behavior based on environmental feedback
- **Persistent**: Continues working towards goals over extended periods
- **Planning**: Can break down complex goals into actionable steps

### Types of Agentic AI

1. **Reactive Agents**: Respond to immediate environmental stimuli
2. **Deliberative Agents**: Plan actions based on goals and world models
3. **Learning Agents**: Improve performance through experience
4. **Multi-Agent Systems**: Multiple agents working together or competing

## ðŸŽ® Agentic AI in Turn-Based Card Games

### Why Card Games Are Ideal for Agentic AI

**Perfect Learning Environment:**
- **Discrete State Space**: Clear game states and actions
- **Turn-Based Nature**: Time to deliberate and plan
- **Strategic Depth**: Requires long-term planning and adaptation
- **Clear Objectives**: Win conditions are well-defined
- **Opponent Modeling**: Learning to predict and counter opponent strategies

### Agent Architecture for Card Games

```python
class CardGameAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.memory = GameMemory()           # Past game experiences
        self.strategy = StrategyModule()      # Current playing strategy
        self.opponent_model = OpponentModel() # Understanding of opponent
        self.planning = PlanningModule()      # Multi-turn planning
    
    def perceive(self, game_state):
        """Analyze current game situation"""
        hand = game_state.player_hand
        board = game_state.board_state
        opponent_actions = game_state.opponent_history
        return self.process_state(hand, board, opponent_actions)
    
    def decide(self, perceived_state):
        """Choose optimal action based on goals"""
        possible_actions = perceived_state.legal_moves
        short_term_plan = self.planning.immediate_tactics(perceived_state)
        long_term_strategy = self.strategy.evaluate_position(perceived_state)
        return self.select_action(possible_actions, short_term_plan, long_term_strategy)
    
    def act(self, chosen_action):
        """Execute the chosen action"""
        result = self.execute_action(chosen_action)
        self.memory.store_experience(perceived_state, chosen_action, result)
        return result
    
    def learn(self, game_outcome):
        """Update strategy based on game results"""
        self.strategy.update_from_outcome(game_outcome)
        self.opponent_model.update_patterns(self.memory.get_opponent_patterns())
```

### Agentic Behaviors in Card Games

**Strategic Planning:**
- Multi-turn combo setup
- Resource management over time
- Win condition planning

**Opponent Modeling:**
- Learning opponent's play patterns
- Predicting likely opponent moves
- Adapting strategy based on opponent type

**Risk Assessment:**
- Evaluating trade-offs between immediate and long-term gains
- Managing uncertainty and hidden information
- Calculating probability-based decisions

## ðŸ”— Connection to Reinforcement Learning

### How Agentic AI and RL Work Together

**Reinforcement Learning** provides the learning mechanism:
- Trial and error through game experience
- Reward signals from wins/losses
- Policy improvement over time

**Agentic Architecture** provides the decision-making framework:
- Goal-oriented behavior
- Memory and planning systems
- Multi-component agent design

### Integration Approach

```python
class AgenticRLCardPlayer:
    def __init__(self):
        # RL Component (see PPO research)
        self.policy_network = PPOPolicyNetwork()
        self.value_network = PPOValueNetwork()
        
        # Agentic Components
        self.working_memory = WorkingMemory()
        self.long_term_memory = LongTermMemory()
        self.goal_manager = GoalManager()
        self.planner = MultiTurnPlanner()
    
    def play_turn(self, game_state):
        # Agentic perception and goal setting
        current_goals = self.goal_manager.assess_situation(game_state)
        planned_sequence = self.planner.create_plan(game_state, current_goals)
        
        # RL decision making for immediate action
        state_representation = self.encode_state(game_state, planned_sequence)
        action_probabilities = self.policy_network(state_representation)
        chosen_action = self.sample_action(action_probabilities)
        
        # Update agentic components
        self.working_memory.update(game_state, chosen_action)
        return chosen_action
```
